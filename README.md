# Primitivo
Procedural Primitives for Blender

This addon packages a collection of basic procedural primtives with a bit of glue code to make it easy to add these to the scene through the use of the 'Add' menu.
The primitives themselves are just geometry nodes networks and can be tweaked freely after the object has been created.
